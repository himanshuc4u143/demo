    description: "The objective is to predict person child T1D or not. We have used temporal predictive approach to leverage our longitudinal data. Temporal predictive approach address some of the challenges faced in using EHR data these challenges include irregularly sampled data and varying lengths of patient history. Data points unevenly distributed over 0-15 years, we have computed 6 sub-intervals (0-2,2-4,4-6,6-8,8-11,11-15). We have used some of as genetic ,antibodies , bloodbiomarker demographics, family history data. In multitask temporal approach we consider the task of predicting the T1D in each subinterval while creating data for subinterval features are aggregated within time window. We used this subinterval model result to create a meta-Training dataset on this meta-Training dataset we create a Meta-Model to learn weights for each task simultaneously (Multi-Task learning). For subinterval model M1 to M6 we have tried different ML model, but we come up with Logistic Regression performing good as well as for final MTTM Model ( x )= w1M1( x ) + â€¦ + w6M6( x ) . This method can be can be adopted to be used over different sub timelines, MTTM can be used as an assistance-tool within a screening program",

    description: "The purpose and impact of our project are centered around predicting future humidity levels with precision and reliability. In environments where humidity control is critical, such as vaccine production facilities, maintaining specific humidity levels is paramount to ensure product quality and efficacy.By accurately forecasting humidity fluctuations, our project aims to provide the necessary insights and tools to maintain optimal conditions in these sensitive environments. This not only safeguards the integrity of vaccine production but also contributes to the broader goal of public health by ensuring the effectiveness and safety of vaccines.Moreover, our project has the potential to streamline operations and reduce costs associated with manual monitoring and adjustment of humidity levels. By automating this process based on predictive models, we can enhance efficiency and minimize the risk of human error, ultimately improving overall productivity and reliability in vaccine manufacturing.In summary, the purpose and impact of our project lie in its ability to forecast future humidity levels with precision, thereby enabling the maintenance of optimal conditions for vaccine production. This contributes to the quality, safety, and efficiency of vaccine manufacturing processes, ultimately benefiting public health initiatives worldwide.",
